Language is a tool for communication.

In this learning program, we use English to give instructions and share information with learners.

Similarly, computer programming languages communicate with computers by providing instructions.

These Programming languages help us represent data like numbers, text, and images and also provide instructions to work with that data.

You don't need to be a computer science expert or a math genius to write a computer program. If you understand basic logic, you can write computer programs easily.

There are many programming languages available. Here I will talk about programming language called Python.

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.

In English, to greet someone, you say "Hello!". Similarly in Spanish, one would say "Hola!".

For example, if we want the computer to display a greeting message, we provide instructions in a computer programming language. In Python we provide instructions in the below format
print("Hello!")
The above text is called source code or simply code. Since it is written in Python, it is called Python code.

The above code represents a simple Python program which prints "Hello!".

In the above case, we have provided some instructions in a computer programming language to the computer to display a greeting message. This sequence of instructions is called a program.

The Python programming language was developed in the 1980s by Guido Van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
Programming languages can be classified into the below three categories:

Low-level programming languages: It involves communication with the system in binary format , consisting of 0's and 1's, which can be directly executed. These languages provide instructions that can be used to perform low-level operations such as memory management. 
An example of such language is Assembly Language.

High-level programming language: In this, the communication with system occurs in the form of text (usually in English), which is easily readable and understandable by humans. 
Examples of such Languages include Ada, JavaScript, Python, Ruby etc.

Middle-level programming languages: These are the languages which support both low-level and high-level features. These are also written in human readable text. They typically use tools like compilers to convert the human readable instructions (high-level language constructs) into low-level executable code (usually in binary format). 
Eg: C, C++, Java, etc,.

Python versions:
Guido Van Rossum published the first version of Python code (Python 0.9.0) at alt.sources in February 1991. This release included exception handling, functions and the core data types.
Python 1.0 released in January 1994. It included filters, map, reduce and lambda.

Python 2.0 released in October 2000. Features include list comprehension and garbage collection with reference cycles.

Python 3.0 released in December 2008. This release removed duplicate constructs and modules, but it was not backward compatible with previous versions..

Python can be used for creating computer applications, computer games or even for testing microchips.
